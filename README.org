#+TITLE: Ibrahim's build of dwm

Basically stolen from [[https://lukesmith.xyz][Luke Smith]]

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/ibrahimmuftee/dwm
  cd dwm
  sudo make install
#+end_src


* Please install =libxft-bgra=!

This build of dwm does not block color emoji in the status/info bar, so you must install [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/][libxft-bgra]] from the AUR, which fixes a libxft color emoji rendering problem, otherwise dwm will crash upon trying to render one. Hopefully this fix will be in all libxft soon enough.
